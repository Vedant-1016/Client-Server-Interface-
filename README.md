 As the name suggests we have created a very basic chat or network application for our end-sem system programming course project. It is build in C++ using our course learnings like *Socket Programming*,*Multithreading* etc. It works very simply i.e it allows multiple clients to connect to a server,exchange messages, and receive join/leave notifications. We feel it still needs a lot of improvements,modifications,more real-time features to make it a perfect platform to interact.Hence we our open for your suggestions.
## Features
- Multiple client connections
- Real-time message environment
- Unique Username
- Join/leave notifications
## Used Knowledge from course
  - C++ language
  - Socket Programming (Network Programming Module)
  - Threads(POSIX THREAD:Concurrent Programming Module)
## Steps to Use:
1)Compile Both client and server code in your terminal( Dont forget to use -pthread while compiling).
2)Run the server and client in different terminals
3)Create as many clients of your choice and give each a unique username
4)Thats it start sharing your,ideas and thoughts with your friend
##Functionality of server code
##Functionality of client code
##Future Improvements
-Private Group chatting
-Storing History of Messages
-Blocking/Unblocking of particular usernames
