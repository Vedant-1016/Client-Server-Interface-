### As the name suggests we have created a very basic chat or network application for our end-sem system programming course project. It is build in C++ using our course learnings like *Socket Programming*,*Multithreading* etc. It works very simply i.e it allows multiple clients to connect to a server,exchange messages, and receive join/leave notifications. We feel it still needs a lot of improvements,modifications,real-time features to make it a perfect platform to interact.Hence we our open for your suggestions.
